# Bus Stop Extractor for Eckero Linjen AB

The website <https://www.eckerolinjen.ax/> does not provide an easy way to list all bus stops. This script extracts all bus stops mentioned in the website.

This makes further calculations easier, such as calculating the distance between the bus stop and your desired destination.

## Recommendations

Python version recommended: 3.12.6
